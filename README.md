# Dragon Vault (WIP)

**Dragon Vault** is an open-source self-hosted website; created
specifically for managing/playing Dungeons & Dragons campaigns remotely
(through voice calls preferably).

## Features

- Invite-only and designed to be self-hosted (though a public version may be released _if there is demand_)
- Allows users to create and manage their own Campaign
- Campaigns allow for custom Characters (custom types of resource pools, items, skills, etc.)
- Manages DND Sessions easily by allowing for easy dice rolls and viewing of a character's information (and items, etc.)
- Allows the DM (Dungeon Master), during a session, to enable a whiteboard that displays details easily in combat

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js `>=24`
- PostgreSQL `>=18`

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlecSouthward/dragon-vault.git
cd dragon-vault

cd backend/
npm install

cd ../frontend/
npm install
```

Make sure you have a PostgreSQL instance and a Dragon Vault database on it.
If you do, then run the `database/init.sql` script to add the necessary tables and some useful data into it.

### Running

This can be used for either the Frontend or Backend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Please note**: The Frontend _requires_ a `.env` file in it's directory, while (for development) the Backend requires a `.env.development` file in it's directory.
